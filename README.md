#Polygon Art

This project is mostly experimenting with creating simple artistic looking patters using modern javascript. 
The project is still in very early alpha, so expect it not to work correctly most of the time.

## Libraries
At the moment there are two external libraries used:

- paper.js
- jQuery

I'll assume you knwo jQuery. Paper.js is used for drawing.

##Browser support
This project is, as said, in alpha and so not heavily test cross browser. At the moment there is no fallback for input type range,
so your probably better off viewing this on a webkit browser.
